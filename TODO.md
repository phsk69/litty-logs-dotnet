## manifesting these features 🧠✨

stuff that would go absolutely crazy but aint started yet. vibes only rn

- 💬 **Slack webhook sink** — Block Kit formatter, similar pattern to Matrix/Teams
- 🟣 **Matrix Client-Server API** — direct room messages with access token + room ID for power users who want full HTML control instead of hookshot
- 🎨 **custom webhook templates** — user-defined message format strings so you can make it look however you want
- 🗜️ **zstd compression** — for file sink rotation (gzip is cool but zstd is faster and smaller)
- 📊 **structured log enrichment** — auto-attach machine name, environment, correlation IDs to webhook messages
